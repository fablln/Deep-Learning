    "This is interesting, we see that the sentences have some sort of sense, but when we reach a point, we see the same sentence repated many times. Thus is probably due to overfitting, we should look more deeply. We see that the repeated sentence is different from the original one, but it is still always the same. We think this is due to the fact that the dot start always the same sentence. Maybe we could create more layers and see what happens."

In this case we see that whole sentences are copied from the original fable, but they are not repeated exactly, we still see that some sentences are repeated, but at this point we think that this is due to the limited training set."
